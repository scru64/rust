SCRU64 ID offers compact, time-ordered unique identifiers generated by
distributed nodes. SCRU64 has the following features:

- ~62-bit non-negative integer storable as signed/unsigned 64-bit integer
- Sortable by generation time (as integer and as text)
- 12-digit case-insensitive textual representation (Base36)
- ~38-bit Unix epoch-based timestamp that ensures useful life until year 4261
- Variable-length node/machine ID and counter fields that share 24 bits

```rust
// pass node ID through environment variable
std::env::set_var("SCRU64_NODE_SPEC", "42/8");

// generate a new identifier object
let x = scru64::new();
println!("{}", x); // e.g., "0u2r85hm2pt3"
println!("{}", x.to_u64()); // as a 64-bit unsigned integer

// generate a textual representation directly
println!("{}", scru64::new_string()); // e.g., "0u2r85hm2pt4"
```

See [SCRU64 Specification] for details.

SCRU64's uniqueness is realm-specific, i.e., dependent on the centralized
assignment of node ID to each generator. If you need decentralized, globally
unique time-ordered identifiers, consider [SCRU128].

## Crate features

Default features:

- `std` integrates the library with, among others, the system clock to draw
  current timestamps. Without `std`, this crate provides limited functionality
  available under `no_std` environments.
- `global_gen` (implies `std`) enables the primary `new()` and `new_string()`
  functions and the process-wide global generator under the hood.

Optional features:

- `serde` enables serialization/deserialization via serde.
- `tokio` (together with `global_gen`) enables the `async_tokio::new()` and
  `async_tokio::new_string()` functions, the non-blocking counterpart of `new()`
  and `new_string()`.
